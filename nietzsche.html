<p>Nietzsche is by far the most popular individual thinker on the New Right. Why is this? </p>


<p>Let’s go back in time to around 60 years ago. Central to the idea of the Old Right is the ideology and mythos of the Civil Rights era Left. This may sound far-fetched, but it is indeed True. Think of the archetypal Boomercon trying to furiously justify his anti-racism before the Trump era: you probably imagined him quoting MLK Jr’s I had a dream speech and droning on about “content of character” and so forth. Indeed, one can almost say that the Civil Rights era was the real founding of America for the modern regime, one in which the Right has constantly ceded ground precisely because of the adherence to these counterproductive Idols (or Götze, according to Nietzsche).
</p>

  <p>The past, at minimum, 20 years have been a parallel to what Nietzsche referred to in his later works as European Nihilism. We see this in the cultural resurgence of explicit nihilism, utilitarianism, rationalism, collapse in values, ressentiment, socialism, and other forms of herd morality. In fact, the leftist’s highest value is suicide (both personal and civilizational) itself - any kind of life-negating behavior in service of a worldview that oozes resentment is heralded as their God. Therefore, we can see the modern Left and the New Right as competing forces, trying to battle out between imposing Passive Nihilism (resignation, despair, The Last Man) and Active Nihilism, clearing away dead values to make room for the higher types of Man that will create new values. 
</p>

  <blockquote><em>“The noble type of man experiences himself as one who determines values; he does not need approval; he judges: ‘What is harmful to me is harmful in itself; he knows himself to be that which in general first accords honor to things; he creates values.’”
 (BGE §260)
</em></blockquote>

  <p>Thus, we can see the necessity of the creation of new values to the right, or at least the destruction of old ones systematically imposed on the Right such that we even forgot that they were there. This all sounds cool, but it’s still theoretical and vague. What values? What did Nietzsche really believe politically? What ends was one supposed to follow in order to create values? 
</p>
  <p>To answer these questions, we must take a tangential path down to Nietzsche’s understanding of what the philosopher is, because out of the philosopher comes the type that Creates. Nietzsche’s idea of the philosopher is the “man of tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow”. Here we see the foremost point in which the New Right differs from the Old. What the Old tries to conserve, constrained under decadent Idols and Regimes, the New wishes to move past and into something more noble. However, these “new” ideas are still based in nature (φύσις). 
</p>
  <p>Chief amongst the values of the New Right is total rejection of the concept of egalitarianism. Nietzsche himself was virulently opposed to any ideology or value system that had egalitarianism baked into it (Marxism, socialism, primitive democracy, etc). Whilst mainstream academics have tried to sanitize Nietzsche for the masses as some kind of wholesome-chungus- humanist, those who had the capacity to actually read his works are clearly able to see the obvious superstratum of hereditarianism, dismissal of tabula rasa, and recognition of rank-order in his overarching project. In fact nothing demonstrates this (successful on the masses) sanitization better than the competing interpretations of what the Overman is between the Left and New Right. I will lay both interpretations out, and put a quote from Zarathustra to see which one fits Nietzsche better.  
</p>
  <p>If the leftist doesn’t automatically try to even dismiss the notion of an Overman, the Leftist then says “the Overman is a humanist, he is an archetype that anyone can become in a lifetime.”
</p>
  <p>The right says “the Overman is the philosopher. The overman has been molded by nature, and baked by nurture precisely to take on the necessary project of value creations, not for any humanistic reasons, but for the purpose of glory and ‘fame imperishable’.”
</p>

  <blockquote><em>“You need to have been born for any higher world; to say it more clearly, you need to have been bred for it: only your descent, your ancestry can give you a right to philosophy – taking that word in its highest sense. Even here, “bloodline” is decisive. The preparatory labor of many generations is needed for a philosopher to come about; each of his virtues needs to have been individually acquired, cared for, passed down, and incorporated…” 
(BGE §213)
</em></blockquote>

  <blockquote><em>“Could you create a God? - Then, I pray you, be silent about all gods! But you could well create the overman. Not perhaps you yourselves, my brothers! But into fathers and forefathers of the overman could you transform yourselves: and let that be your best creating” (Zarathustra, Part 2 (2), In the Happy Isles)
</em></blockquote>

  
  <p>Academics like Kaufmann remove references to the word “bred” or “bloodline” or handwave it away as a metaphor, in order to make Nietzsche more palatable for the intellectually narrow-minded, stuck in the traditional thought processes of the past 100 years. However, any intellectually honest reading of Nietzsche results in a mode of thinking much closer to the New Right, though they may irritate our ears infected with the disease that is postmodernism – in fact smart Marxists recognize the philosophical tensions between Marx and Nietzsche, but refuse to follow it to its logical conclusion, i.e. Foucault saying that “individual members of the proletariat desire a proletariat revolution for their own sake, that they may have more power”, and not realizing the inherent contradictions with Nietzsche. 
</p>

  <p>Mainstream conservatives, not willing to indulge in vandalism of the Overton Window,  view only the past ~20 years of liberalism as an aberration against the norm. This line of thinking is too stuck in the present and misdiagnoses the problem as uniquely modern. 
</p>
  <p>It is in fact the opposite – the creation of a polity that has surplus in goods, novel ideas, and in the production of great men and superhuman feats is a historical act of insurmountable odds. The New Right realizes this and says that the most important political act is not any specific policy position (limited government, tariffs, industrial policy, though these may help), but rather the liberation of those individuals from the suffocation of commune and the primitive democracy, defined by an inability to see beyond the current norms and values (νόμος). 
</p>
  <p>It is of the utmost importance to recognize the path that we are currently heading down in the United States, best stated as a gynocratic-gerontocracy. Make no mistake, this is the historic norm: primitive societies have always been ruled by a Council of Elders, and norms set by such constructs are enforced by The Matriarchs. However era-specific this phenomenon may seem, a select group of individuals’ will to overcome νόμος and see beyond it via philosophy is the most important justification of the New Right, as seen empirically throughout history in the success of The West at large over the past ~800 years. 
</p>
  <p>To those understanding the arguments put forth, it should be clear now that polities, nations, states, and, maybe, what one calls “civilization” should be centered around the ambitions of the lofty individual. Without this, there is neither potential nor a vision for tomorrow, and the day after. That kind of “civilization”, if it can even be called that, is simply a reduction back to the nihilism of the democratic man. 
</p>

  <p>This recognition of self, that much of society so desperately tries to stifle, is what Nietzsche sees as the Will to Power in the higher type  that base-civilization views as dangerous. 
</p>
<blockquote><em>“A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at five or six great men- yes, and then to get around them.”
</em></blockquote>
<p>It is this instinct that the New Right wishes to nurture and pass on, such that civilization itself can reach a new height where herd instincts previously subdued it. Perhaps, and one must hope that it is that place, at that height, where the Overman can be molded.
