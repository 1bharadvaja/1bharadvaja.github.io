      <p>I am not a proficient economist, nor am I an expert political theorist. However, I have been lately thinking about the future of the American empire, and whether Americans stand to benefit from whatever it is that the White House is doing with regards to dismantling various institutions that serve to project American power across the world. I recently read what I thought was a brilliant post by @Yishan on X, where he claimed that the reason the American empire has been so successful is because its instruments of power are held secretly behind “international” institutions (that are pretty obviously still exist to serve American interests). I have implicitly understood this – it should be obvious to anyone who follows politics that the UN does literally nothing of consequence. It should also be obvious that the UN is very clearly controlled mostly by the US and its interests, and that this is not a “happy accident”. It had not occurred to me, however, that this was done to hide the power of the American empire behind some semblance of an international democratic order (lol). 
</p>

      <p>Now, the current administration has explicitly stated that their goals include dismantling many of the institutions that the state previously used to project its power internationally via promoting the liberal post-war consensus, like USAID. The question I have had to ask myself is: is this good? My instinct is that it certainly is. USAID was known to have funded many international feminist projects and “sex-change” operation centers. We should be overjoyed that that moral rot is gone. Where does this stop, though? Note that I don’t think that the current administration truly believes in the idea that the US should stop being a hegemon: see attempted acquisition of Greenland, trying to play mediator in Ukraine, etc. We are now hearing much about the costs of being this hegemon, subsidizing Europe, mass immigration, devaluation of American labor, etc. These certainly are big issues, especially mass immigration which should be treated as the biggest issue of this century. But shutting down the empire in totality will obviously have negative economic consequences as well. Americans have been experience what is essentially exponential economic growth via the stock market for the past ~60 years as a consequence of various “imperial” initiatives. The petrodollar, our defense industry, and tech are all the main benefactors of the American empire. Mass immigration drives up house prices in the housing market, which happens to be the primary source of wealth in the boomer’s portfolio. 
</p>

      <p>But all the externalities of the American empire end up being accrued to the underclass/newer generations (notwithstanding the damage we cause to people in other countries), is it really a surprise then when even a subsection of MAGA wants to end the hegemony?

</p>
<p>Another important question to be asked: is it possible to remain an empire without some level of immigration? I think not. Debates will be had over these problems, which I believe will become the most pressing of all issues in the coming decades. What I know, however, is that what must be dismantled above all is this gerontocracy that seeks to resist any solution that is posed. We must not end up with a country that chiefly serves the interests of the old. The young are feared, and for good reason. Whether we will prove these fears right will be the crux of America’s future.
