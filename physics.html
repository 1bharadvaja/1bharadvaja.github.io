<p>A pen of unit length is lying tilted on a rough table.</p>
<p>The lower end of the pen is dragged in the horizontal direction until the pen becomes vertical. During this process, the upper end of the pen travels a unit distance.</p>
<p>How many units does the lower end travel?</p>
<p>Assume that the velocity of the upper end of the pen is always parallel to the pen.</p>
