<h2>First Problem You'll Be Tackling</h2>
<img class="animated-gif" src="https://themartian117.github.io/8f0d9fbb70ba0b1f46b20870a245a78aaf61e1b1.gif"></img>
<p>A pen of unit length is lying tilted on a rough table.</p>
<p>The lower end of the pen is dragged in the horizontal direction until the pen becomes vertical. During this process, the upper end of the pen travels a unit distance.</p>
<p>How many units does the lower end travel?</p>
<p>Assume that the velocity of the upper end of the pen is always parallel to the pen.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
    <p>First thing we can do, is draw a mini diagram of this.</p>
    <img src = "themartian117.github.io/diagram.png"></img>
    <p>In this picture, we need to find x, which is simple found by integrating dx, but we dont know the full bounds of integration.</p>
<p>We can substitute ${\mathrm{d}x}$ for $\csc\theta {\mathrm{d} \theta }$. We then integrate $\int_{\theta =a}^{\pi \over2}\csc\theta {\mathrm{d} \theta }$. We do not know the lower bound of the integral, therefore we need to find it by using another integral.</p>
<p>We have to use another integral, at this point, to find the lower bound for the integral. We know that the top of the pen moves 1 unit. 
    This means P = 1. You can set 1 = $\int_{a}^{\pi \over 2}{\mathrm{d}p} = \int_{a}^{\pi  \over 2} \cot \theta {\mathrm{d} \theta } $. This is because in the diagram, $\cot \theta =$${\mathrm{d} p} \over {\mathrm{d} \theta }$, so therefore $\cot \theta {\mathrm{d} \theta } = {\mathrm{d} p}$.</p>
<p>$\int_{a}^{\pi  \over 2} \cot \theta {\mathrm{d} \theta } = \ln |\sin \frac{\pi }{2}|-\ln |\sin \alpha |$ </p>
<p>$\ln |\sin \frac{\pi }{2}|-\ln |\sin \alpha | = 1$. Then you can solve, $\ln |\sin \frac{\pi }{2}| = 0$ and $0-\ln |\sin \alpha | = 1$</p>
<p>Since $-\ln |\sin \alpha | = 1$, $e^{-1} = \sin \theta$, so therefore, $\theta = \arcsin (\frac{1}{e})$. Now we have found out the lower bound.</p>
<p>Now we can evaluate the first integral. $\int_{\arcsin (\frac{1}{e})}^{\pi \over2}\csc\theta {\mathrm{d} \theta }$. 
<p>This evaluates to $-\ln|\csc \frac{\pi}{2} + \cot \frac{\pi}{2}| + \ln|\csc (\arcsin (\frac{1}{e}))+ \cot (\arcsin (\frac{1}{e}))|$. At this point, we can draw a triangle to figure out the values.</p>
<img src = "themartian117.github.io/triangle.png"></img>
<p>As you can see, we have put out the values on the triangle, and now, we have to find out the cosecant and cotangentvalues. According to this triangle, $\csc \theta = e$, and then $\cot \theta = \sqrt{e^{2}-1}$.
<p>This gives you the answer of $\ln|e + \sqrt{e^{2}-1}|$. And the problem is solved!

 <h2>Second Problem</h2>
<p>Prove the relationship between Gauss's Law for electricity and Coulomb's Law.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Okay, so this proof is fairly straight forward. Gauss's Law states that $\epsilon_{0}\int\vec{E}\cdot{\mathrm{d}A} = q_{enc}$, while Coulombs Law states $E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}} \frac{q_{1}}{r^{2}}$.<p>
<p>Gauss's law conceptually states that the net electric flux is proportional to the net electrical charge by a constant of proportionality of $\frac {1}{\epsilon_{0}}$, while Coulomb's Law conceptually states that electric force and electric field strength are inversely proportional to $r^{2}$.</p>
<p>Now we can go about proving the relationship.</p>
<p>$\epsilon_{0}\int\vec{E}\cdot{\mathrm{d}A} = q_{enc}$. We can take out the electric field vector $\vec{E}$, because it is the same regardless of where it is on the surface.
    Now our integral is $\epsilon_{0}E\int{\mathrm{d}A}$.</p>
    <p>Now the integral is simply the sum of all the differntials of the sphere, which happens to be the surface area, or $4\pi r^{2}$.</p>
    <p>This gives us the equation $\epsilon_{0}E(4\pi r^{2}) = q_{enc}$. Some rearranging gives us the formula $E = \frac{q_{enc}}{4\pi r^{2}\epsilon_{0}}$, and the relationship is thus proved.</p>
<h2>Third Problem</h2>
<p>Consider a three-dimensional shape standing on the floor with height $\frac{\pi}{2} \text{cm}$ such that the area of a cross section parallel to the floor is $14\sin x\cdot \cos x \text{ cm}^2$ for any height $0 \le x \le \frac{\pi}{2}\text{ cm}.$ What is the volume of the three-dimensional shape in $\text{cm}^3$?
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>You know the three dimensions of the solid which are $14\sin x$, $\cos x$, and the height is $\frac{\pi}{2}$.</p>
<p>Now you can integrate to find out the to find out the volume. You sum up infinitely many pieces of height ${\mathrm{d} x}$, and with length and and width of $14\sin x$ and $\cos x$ respectively. The bounds of integration will be from 0 to $\frac{\pi}{2}$</p>
<p>Integrating $\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}14\sin x \cdot \cos x$ gives us the result of <strong>7</strong>, and that is our answer.</p>
<h2>Fourth Problem</p>
<p id = "credit">This problem was created by a brilliant.org user named Michael Ng. All credit goes to him for this problem. </p>
<p>A bullet is formed by revolving the area bounded by the the curve $y = \ln(x)$ from $x = 1$ to $x = e$ about the $x$-axis.</p>
<p>It is then shot straight into a very thick wall (i.e. it does not pierce through the other side at all) making a closed cylindrical hole until it stops moving.</p>
<p>Then the bullet is carefully extracted without affecting the hole at all, leaving an empty hole with a pointy end where the bullet once was.
The length of the entire hole is $e + 1$.</p>
<p>If the volume of the hole can be expressed $\pi i e,$ as where $i$ is a constant, find the value of $i$.</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>The plan is to find the volume first, then divide the volume by $\pi$ and $e$ to get to $i$.</p>
<p>Since the curve is $\ln(x)$ from from $x=1$ to $x=e$, we can graph this portion and revolve it around the $x$-axis to get the shape of the bullet.</p>
<p>Once that is done, you know the length of the bullet to be $e-1$. This means that after hitting the point $(e-1, y)$ (y is the value of the function at $e-1$, but it is not needed in this problem), in the wall, the height of the hole is the same until $e+1$.<p>
<p>You can represent this as a sum of two integrals. By using the disc method, we know that until the point $(e-1, y)$, the height or radius of the circle is going to be $\ln(x)$, and after that point, the height will be constant until the point $(e+1, z)$, where the hole ends.</p>
<p>The two integrals will be $\pi\int_{0}^{e-1}{(\ln(x))}^2 {\mathrm {d}x} + \pi\int_{e-1}^{e+1}{0.54132}^2 {\mathrm {d}x}$. In this case, $0.54132$ is the constant height of the function after hitting $e-1$.</p>
<p>If you don't know the disc method, go to the <a href = "https://brilliant.org/wiki/disc-method/#volume-of-revolution-disc-method-easy">brilliant.org</a> amazing wiki where you can learn about it.</p>
<p>Continuing with the problem, the sum of integrals evaluates to approximately $8.37496327997$, but remember that is not our answer.</p>
<p>We have to find the constant $i$, which is basically our answer divided by $\pi e$. So we perform our calculations and we get $0.98$, and w round that to $1$, and that is our answer.</p>
