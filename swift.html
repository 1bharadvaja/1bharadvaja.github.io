  <h1>Learn Swift</h1>
     <p>Swift is a language for programming iOS apps. The previous iOS programming language, Objective-C, is long gone.<p>
      <p>Swift has 3 main things you need to use. There are things called variables, which you initialize by saying "var someVar", which means the value can change, or saying "let myLetVar".</p>
      <p>To make it so that you don't have any errors, when you declare the variable, you nheed to give it a type. Ex. "let myLetVar: String"
            The types are Double, Int, Float, String. You declare based on what the variable is used for. And then, If you want to declare what the variable will store straight away, you will need to do "var myVar: String = "Hello World".<p>
      <p>Print statements print what you want to say to the console. For example you can take the variable we made, and say "print(myVar)" which will print out "Hello World"!</p>
      <p>Another type that is important in Swift are <strong>methods</strong>. Methods are the same as functions. To initialize a function, say "func myFunc()"</p>
      <p>An example of what we just did.</p>
