<h1>Welcome To My Portfolio Site!</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Anirudh Bharadwaj, but you can call me Ani. On this website, I'll be sharing my day to day experiences, my accomplishments, and my passions.</p> 
<p>I aspire to be a leading scientist or mathematician that will make advancements to push society forward. I'm extremely passionate about math and physics (and I have a seperate page where I talk about that <a href = "https://anirudh-b.github.io/math.html">here</a>). I also really love musics, and in particular singing. I've been singing classical South Indian Music for 6 to 7 years, and I've come to really love it.
  In my free time, I play my favorite sport (volleyball), code, and solve math problems just for the fun.</p>
