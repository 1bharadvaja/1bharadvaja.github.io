<p>Recently, I have taken a deep interest in mining and rare earth metals. Mining is one of those traditional industries that I think has so much potential to be revolutionized in the coming years, especially considering the new possibility of finally being able to utilize the depth of unstructured mining data there is on the internet. 
</p>

      <p>When it comes to prospecting, mining companies traditionally use statistical methods to interpolate their drill hole data. That is, they drill say 100 holes in the ground and use traditional statistical methods in order to estimate the concentrations of various minerals/metals using the data they collected. For example, the Kriging method is one of these traditional statistical tools used for estimating desired variables in mining. You can think of Kriging as a kind of prediction tool, where points in space close to known data points are given more weight than ones further away. The problem with this is that these tools tend to bake in human knowledge into their estimations. Yes, you heard that right. That is a problem. You may be thinking “Wait. Hmm. Isn’t that good? Don’t we want as much knowledge pre-baked into our methods as possible?” 
</p>
      <p>This, precisely, is the bitter lesson in AI. One that companies and–more broadly–industries will learn soon, now that we are in the age of very large models. Summarized, the bitter lesson says that methods that leverage large amounts of computation, data, and search power win out over methods that tend to leverage human knowledge and “neat tricks”. In mining, these neat tricks are the Krigings and RBF functions of the field. In other areas, like NLP, the neat tricks were human knowledge of phonemes, tongue placement, etc. In the end, those methods got obliterated by statistical methods like Hidden Markov Models. 
</p>
      <p>Ok, back to what this means for mining. From my foraging into this field, if I have one takeaway, it is this: usable data is like diamonds, or was. Drill hole data is hard to find, and it’s even harder to use. One of the ways that I have acquired data is through parsing the drill data of publicly traded mining companies (they have to file SK-1300 reports and list their drill holes), something that would have been nearly impossible before the advent of GPT and other LLMs. Mining has been able to defeat part of the bitter lesson via statistical methods. Now, I believe it is time for the industry to take advantage of the amount of unprocessed data there is available on the internet, and use it to build models that are essentially the most accurate mappings of whatever is underground. This should truly be multimodal. 
</p>
      <p>I remember first hearing about RenTech (the quant fund) and thinking to myself “Wow, they must have the most new/shiny technology and have new & “esoteric” mathematical methods to predict the market”. And while that may be true, my understanding is that their main advantage is that they just have a shit ton of data. Tons and tons of it. Data on weather, data on commodities obviously, and data on things you probably wouldn’t think is correlated with the market at a cursory glance. 
</p>
      <p>If companies in the mining space can do this, then you have essentially one part of the mining process solved. This can be extended towards deep-sea mining, which admittedly I don’t know much about, but seems promising. We already know there is an abundance of resources beneath the Earth’s crust and oceans - why not take advantage of it? Perhaps this can even be extended to space as well–certainly the first settlers on Mars will have to mine, as it will likely be economically infeasible to ship rockets that only carry raw materials. Even right now, the tariffs on Aluminum imports and potential acquisition of Greenland (no doubt for its rare earth metals), poses the problem of how and when mining is going to resurge in America. 
</p>
<p>This mission is what I am most interested in. It’s an unsolved problem that will carry great civilizational effects if there is a breakthrough. And breakthroughs, as we all now know, are simply inevitable.
