    <div class="card card-1"> <h3><center>XprAI</center></h3>
    <p>This was a submission to LingHacks 2019. Our inspiration was the sheer amoutn of mental illness that is the result of stressors
        in society. We wanted an easy, automated way of diagnosing that. Me and my teammate basically used OpenCV, and also combined 
        NLTK with a Tensorflow ML model to determine sentiment. We created a program where a bot asks questions to a person, while running OpenCV
        in the background to detect someone's emotions (using a simple function we built with haarcascades). Through this process, it determines, if you seem to be happy, or if you seem to be sad, depressed, or even suicidal.
        Below is an image of HaarCascades in action when the program is running.

    <h3><center>Proboscis</center></h3>
    <p>This was a submission for LaunchHacks 2019. This project was based on early malaria detection in underprivileged countries, but still had access to computers. 
        My team and I wrote a CNN model to train with the Kaggle malaria dataset, which contained around 27,000 images of a blood cell
        that was either infected, or not. After programming a successful model, we got a Heroku web server, and configured Python to run on it. We then programmed the frontend of our website
        to go hand in hand with our backend, which ran the TensorFlow code.Below is what the prediction looks like. You upload an image, and it alerts you whether 
        the cell has malaria or not. We achieved a 90% accuracy!</p>

    <h3><center>Py-Sics</center></h3>
<p>This was a pretty simple project, because it was my first hackathon project. The purpose of it was togive an understanding of
    much more advanced physics. The project also functioned as a program which graphed a multivariable equation, to help give students a
    visual of what higher science on physics looks like. It calculates work, and other interesting things. Below is what it looks like</p>

    <center><h3>Arms-Safe</h3></center>
    <p>This was an object detection program that incorporated TensorFlow object detection API, and its usage was for detecting guns that show up on a camera. 
        The main purpose of this project was to build a prototype on what cameras could be used for security wise when preventing school shootings, which are prevalent
        these days in America. This project was for Atoms and Bits hackathon (3rd place winner).</p>
