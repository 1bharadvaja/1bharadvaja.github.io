  <h1>What I'll Be Doing On Here</h1>
  <p>So on this page that I now have, I'll be talking about a few things, such as problem solving, programming topics, and much more. 
    My programming path started off with Python, then slowly progressed to other areas such as front end and backend developement, and I continue to hone my skills. 
  This website will house all my projects, and I will talk about them here.</p>
  <h1>Current And Past Projects</h1>
  	<ul>
      <li>Project XprAI. This was a hackathon project at LingHacks 2019. It was mainly based on using OpenCV, 
        and an AI model to process emotion and text to determine if a person is suicidal or depressed. You can go check it out at <a  href = "https://devpost.com/software/xprai-13mlix">here</a> on devpost</li>
      <li>Project Proboscis. This was a submission or LaunchHacks 2019. In this project we built a server, and configured Heroku to run python code.
      Then, we built a Convolutional Neural Network to detect Malaria in a blood sample. We let the user upload a picture of a malaria cell,
      and the website tell you if the blood sample is infected or not. Check it out at <a href = "http://proboscis.tech">here</a></li>
      <li>One of my other projects was built for the Reddit community of <a href = "https://reddit.com/r/dogecoin">r/Dogecoin
</a>. It implemented an easy way to check your Dogecoin balance, and a QR Code scanner to scan it quickly.
  It also had multiple statistics about DogeCoins and a bunch of other cool stuff. If you want to check it out, do so <a href = "https://github.com/anirudh-b/DogeChecker">here</a>.</ul>
  <h1>My Other Pages</h1>
    <p>Visit my Physics page, where I talk about interesting problems <a href = "https://themartian117.github.io/math.html">here.</a>This website is dedicated to explaining some of my favorite fields such as E&M, and Mechanics. </p>
