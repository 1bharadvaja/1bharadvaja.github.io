  <h1>What I'll Be Doing On Here</h1>
  <p>So on this page that I now have, I'll be talking about a few things, such as problem solving, programming topics, and much more. 
    My programming path started off with Python, then slowly progressed to other areas such as front end and backend developement, and I continue to hone my skills. 
  This website will house all my projetcs, and I will talk about them here.</p>
